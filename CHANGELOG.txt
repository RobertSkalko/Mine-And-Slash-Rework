v.5.3.0

CLASS rework BETA:

* in short: skill gems no longer drop (support gems and auras do), instead you get spells by allocating points into classes.
- the class trees will have additional passives later, this is WIP
- basically class system + support gems + aura gems. Hopefully best of both worlds.

- fix mobs not being able to damage each other

- weapon energy costs now have energy per swing and per mob attacked, to balance weapon's between aoe and single target weapons if modpacks want.
The per swing is not exactly per swing, but more per hit + with added cooldown, so it won't cost anything when you fire the bow, only when the arrow hits a mob.
For swords it will work like this:
You attack 3 zombies. The first zombie you spend energy per swing and it's now set on tiny cooldown,
for second zombie it's on cd so not spent, etc. For all 3 zombies you spend the "per mob attacked" energy cost.
Depending on the ratio of per swing vs per mob costs the weapon can be either good at single target or aoe.

- gear base stats should now be per rarity, instead of same for all rarities

- fixed commands breaking after /reload

- fixed elemental resists doubling resists

- fix breed event null

- fix recoil shot shooting you forward

- added stats per spells

- added summon health stat (and special stats that transfer player stats to summons)
In this case the summon health stat gives summons the normal health stat

- summon spells now have innate summon hp and dmg stats per level

v.5.3.1

- try to make arrow totems only target visible enemies.

- fixed backpack slots

- summons now have cast time, summon skeleton is no longer an ultimate (summoners need a ranged attack too)

- fixed resource on kill stats

- michu improved some dungeons to be less harsh

- mana cost is now capped to -75% max

- made summon rarity scale with spell lvl

- maps no longer give massive loot and xp bonuses because they already natively do that by having massive amount of mobs and chests.

- ender pearls and chorus fruits are no longer usable in maps. (this is a config)

v.5.3.2

- affix tiers changed into affix rarities. Highest rarity an affix can get is based on rarity of the gear.
Higher Affix rarities are a lot easier to obtain than the gear rarity (mythic affixes are more often found than mythic items)

- buffs from items now show duration as status effects (but the status effects themselves have nothing to do with the buff) (its just for visual clarity)

- added Korean translation

- added give and reset talent commands

v.5.3.3

- added config and some fixes

v.5.3.4

fixes

v.5.3.5

- added spider summon spell
- pet basic attacks are now spells and their dmg and scaling is displayed if you press shift 
- made a few spells like magma totem not knockback enemies which should make them more useful
- chilling field now has extra vanilla slow
- removed tooltip cutting if too long, it seems vanilla does it anyway so it was double cutting
- increased base mana and energy that scales per lvl
- added explode minions spell
- added LEVEL_DISTANCE_PENALTY_LEEWAY, example if set to 2, mobs 2 lvls higher or lower won't have xp penalty applied, but it starts at 3 lvls higher
- fixed some untranslatable text, not all
- fix stations stopping to work "randomly", turns out caching player no good when player dies
- fixed effects, they now actually disappear and tick and also their stacks work now
- dot dmg can now crit
- removed reflect
- fixed charge regen bug
- your summons will no longer drown trying to attack fish
- gems are now craftable instead

.5.3.6

- GUI OVERHAUL by Skullbushi! The mod should feel more thematic and RPG-like with mostly unified gui theme.
- added downranking of profession gatherable mats, 1 > 1 exchange rate
- attempted to clean up dmg code a bit, now shouldn't be replacing all dmg types anymore, instead just setting the dmg numbers at the end
WEIRD DAMAGE BEHAVIOR MIGHT HAPPEN, SO PLEASE REPORT
- should fix stations taking too many mats if they are spread across stacks
- fixed orb of imbalance
- added map mechanic chance config
- added REMOVE_EMPTY_TOOLTIP_LINES_IF_MORE_THAN_X_LINES client config in case some people play on super small screens/gui sizes
- staffs can now have looting
- try fix spells being casted 1 more time than needed
- fishing crates now respect min map lvl drop

v.5.3.7

- hotfix a map hang, related to a while loop, never again

v.5.3.8

- added random offsets for summonblockaction
- support gem slots are now locked per player level AND spell level. 
- added tracking radius per spell (datapack stuff)
- reduced resonance scaling a little bit and removed charm chance
- summons now have a custom summon rarity
- mob rarities now datapack
- fixed armor pene not scaling to level
- buffed armor pene numbers a bit, changed some to %
-  profession exp datapacks now have optional req list
- new growth stage req to prevent people placing potato, breaking it instantly and gaining xp
- fake players mostly used by automation mods will no longer proc mns profession item bonus drops
- new druid spell: circle of healing. It scales healing with rejuvenation stacks on the target
- tried to separate overlay guis so they can be moved independently
- added garden of thorns ability and inner calm effect
- druid now hopefully has a bit of a "rotation". Rejuv gives you dot healing but also increases your thorn damage.
You scale with energy on both healing and damage and can basic attack mobs to proc extra damage from thorns.
When you're out of mana, you have garden of thorns to deal damage and give you an effect that restores mana which scales with your energy.
Hopefully this will be more fun than the generic spells of before, I hope I can rework existing spells to work similarly.
- adventure map size now configurable
