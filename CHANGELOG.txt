Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.6.txt

v.5.6.4
- added a temp-fix for possible lag during map teleports. First 5s will be silenced
- extractors now tell what rarity gear they can be used on
- added new config, chat exp messages
- added names to features
- map mobs now no longer drop loot and exp if they aren't spawned properly. 
Currently there's 2 ways to spawn a mob properly: mob processors (custom mine and slash feature) and command blocks with /summon command.
The summon command compat only exists temporarily because a few maps use them to spawn mobs.
Any mobs not spawned this way will drop ZERO loot and exp. So vexes spawned by illagers, or any mobs spawned with unintentional mechanics will just drop zero rewards.
