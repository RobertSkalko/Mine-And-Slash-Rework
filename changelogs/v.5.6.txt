Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.6.txt

v.5.6.0
- Medium Profession refactor:
 * easier to understand recipes
 * all recipes now have a tier item + rarity item
 * removed rare gathering mats
 * removed the lesser, greater etc items, drops, stats
 
- datapack warnings are now printed to each player that logs in, but only a short summary
- unbound key should now show that and not just "N"
- new feature: everyone is ally. When spells target only allies, this means they will target anything
- reset spell cooldowns command now merged with other reset player data commands
- small rename of command reset_player_data > reset player_data
- MODPACK WARNING: all point types like (talents, spells etc) are now in the game balance datapack! 
They now use the same system so i can more easily allow stuff like bonus points for stuff besides talents. (bonus talent points will be preserved for now as legacy code)
Previously point configs were spread to both configs and datapacks, and each used different methods..
- added give and reset bonus point commands to all point types now, removed the old talent point commands
- changed favor_per_second in rarity datapack to favor_per_hour
- renamed age of exile package to mine and slash, otherwise loggers would confuse people because package name was age_of_exile
- switched to using loggers so they actually write to log file
- reset potions reworked. Now ALL point types have their own full reset potions and point resets
- you can now remove singular spell, passive, and stat points
- resetting talents no longer resets ascendancy
- asc points now use different reset points potion
- reset potion ids changed btw
- reset points potion now give 10 instead of 5 points
- added can_have_runewords to rarity datapack
- runes, gems, augment and supp gems now show what level they start dropping at 
- more misc tooltip tweaks
- doubled unarmed energy cost
- removed ALWAYS_SCALE_MOB_LEVEL_TO_PLAYER config because the datapack for it exists (per dimension), and it confused players
- added give watcher_eye_jewel command
- fixed watcher eye tooltips
- proc stats now properly set the cooldown of the spell procced and will not cast if the spell is on cooldown.
- removed can_proc_from_procs because not possible to ensure all the following things arent procs.. Like say you proc chill blast, which procs freeze/shatter, which procs ... 
To be safe, i'll go with limiting each proc with spell cooldown. This means currently all procs can proc from procs too. So try to make the proc conditions a bit more strict if needed, or more chance-y
- new info area_level command to see how area lvl was calculated
- added cheat_give points command, so you don't need to edit datapacks to remove point limits for testing
- stations are now separate guis, have names, can click to show recipes etc
- improved consumable buff item tooltips
- new set_tier_nbt boolean to prof recipes, in case you want to craft something that doesnt set tier nbt
- foods and infusions now have rarity glint backgrounds
- foods now show duration
- supp gems and auras now unequip if too low level
- swap button added to overlay, shows swap key if hub is open
- prophecy coins are now items. You can now save them in-between maps but they now come in leveled tiers.
Hopefully they feel more tangible now, and players can now share or distribute them. And hope no exploits
- prophecy curses are now an actual card-picker gui
- lowered radius of nearby mobs prophecy altar check

v.5.6.2
- fix move speed stat and others (i didnt need to add +1 to it..)
- fix mixin connector wrong package name

v.5.6.3
- fix empty affix causing null errors when searching

v.5.6.4
- added a temp-fix for possible lag during map teleports. First 5s will be silenced
- extractors now tell what rarity gear they can be used on
- added new config, chat exp messages
- added names to features
- map mobs now no longer drop loot and exp if they aren't spawned properly. 
Currently there's 2 ways to spawn a mob properly: mob processors (custom mine and slash feature) and command blocks with /summon command.
The summon command compat only exists temporarily because a few maps use them to spawn mobs.
Any mobs not spawned this way will drop ZERO loot and exp. So vexes spawned by illagers, or any mobs spawned with unintentional mechanics will just drop zero rewards.
