Changelog of recent updates: https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework/blob/1.20-Forge/changelogs/v.5.8.txt

v.5.8.0

Currencies Rework

 * All Currencies are now datapacks! They are separated into item requirement datapacks and item modification datapacks.
Every currency is now a list of requirements and modifications.

* Totally revamped the In-Game library gui!
Search bar, filter types, scrolling..

* Characters gui reworked! 
Added rename and delete character options

NOTE: Some items will probably break or lose some of their data this update, because I refactored some code to better prepare for next minecraft versions.
What will probably break: unique items, corruption tag, max uses.
I will probably stop the item data rework here and wait for next update to finish it.

- Datapack change: spells can now allow other spells to benefit from their support gems! This can be used to:
	* make summons use their basic spell attacks and those attacks will benefit from supp gems used on the summon spell
	* spells that cause procs to also allow the proc spells to benefit
- changed summons to now use their basic attack as the spell now that they benefit from supp gems without hardcoded workarounds
- added new currency: Orb of Divine Benevolence
- added new /mine_and_slash item_mod use command to test out item modifications
- added new /mine_and_slash currency use command to use currency on mainhand item only if the requirements on the item pass
- some item ids were changed for currencies like sharpening stones
- added more tooltips
- currencies now have rarities shown in inventory
- new currencies from harvest league
- added even more new currencies
- gems now have rarities (mostly just cosmetic)
- slight perf tweak for stat calc
- some affix.types have been tweaked
- mns gears now override vanilla rarity of the itemstack so it should work with mods like lootbeams. (this will get a performance boost when i totally refactor item data in next mc version port)
- now only weapons are dropped when in main hand if req not met
- cached auto items better
- tiny perf improves to entity data sync
- spell levels should now be readable in the gui and also they change colors when you level them up
- fixed profession recipes not being craftable if they don't have both a tier and a rarity item material
- you can no longer use stat source command on some1 else
- removed mastery seals, just use downrank recipes
- fixed leech % dmg as x stat
- added one_of_a_kind to affix datapack
- added "of paragon's" suffixes, one of a kind rare suffixes that provide multiple stats alongside new jewel effect stat
- simplified the max runes limit on items, now 1 per item, except on runed items
- fixed master bag bug when moving it while open
- added new currencies to upgrade jewels, jewels now have potential

v.5.8.1

- added config to disable spell animations
- fixed newbie bag
- salvage station now drops items that aren't salvagable
- fixed stat soul bugs

v.5.8.2

    fixed orb of ciphers
    fixed opposite spell anim boole
	
v.5.8.3

- added builder utility commands to load all of a dungeon's structure blocks. 
Should be useful when testing or fixing dungeons: /mine_and_slash builder_tool_warning generate_dungeon_pieces
- map device now drops when broken
- crafted gear is now labeled
- gear souls now provide error messages when trying to apply to incorrect item types
- removed the complex mob processor (the 'spawn;rarity;mobtype' one), it will now just delegate to normal `mob` processor, 
this means maps should now hopefully have more modded mobs (if datapack-ed in) instead of zombies and skellies
- stats like "more x per y" and intellect% etc should now benefit from % modifiers. So 5 hp per 1 dodge should now benefit from both hp and dodge, and intellect % should increase mana etc
WARNING, this bugfix will probably boost player power quite a bit! Probably a good idea to nerf % int etc sources 
- should fix swords only hitting 1 enemy
